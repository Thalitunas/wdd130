        <p>Hello! My name is Thalita, I am 22 years old. I am a BYU Pathway Worldwide student, and I am starting to learn about web fundamentals. I like to learn new things and I like to draw, to travel, play sports and to dance. I am a church member since I was 9. My favorite scripture is 2 Nephi 2:25. I am happy for the opportunity to learn with this course, because it will help me a lot in my current and future job. I am excited, even though I know it will be hard.</p>
